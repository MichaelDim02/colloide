#MCD's Colloide v0.5 // 2017 // Thessaloniki, Greece
#Michael Constantine Dimopoulos ----------------------------------------------
Colloide is an extremely simple information gathering tool with the solid purpose of finding working admin login web-pages.
Written with python - meant to be used on linux (Debian)
To open:
1) Locate the file
2) CD to that directory with terminal
3) type "python colloide.py"
--------------------
How it works:
All it does is go through a list (links.txt) with all the common admin page names and finds 
the one that work  the links.txt was taken directly from:
 
https://github.com/bdblackhat/admin-panel-finder/blob/master/link.txt

and I do not own it. There is an option to choose your own
list but it is very unlikely this one won't work.
