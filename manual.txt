MCD's Colloide manual.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to open:
1) Open the terminal
2) Go to the directory colloide.py is inside of
3) Type "python colloide100.py"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The above will run the python script. By doing so you will be
presented with a number of options & arguments. On the very top
you will see "--robots". 

This option is to do a quick check of the
robots.txt file of a website. To run simply execute the following:


	python colloide100.py -u www.example.us -d -c


-u stands for URL. After typing -u make sure to write the
URL (www.example.us) of the site.

-c stands for Content. You can add it to the command if you
want it to show you the contents of the robots.txt file.

-d stands for Dump. Add it to the command to have a .txt
file with the contents of the robots.txt file.

~~~~~~~~~

After --robots you will see two options, --status --urlerror
and a few arguments below them that apply to both.

--status means the program will check if the status
code is 404 (not found) or valid. Use if the site has 
costum 404 pages.

--urlerror means that the program will set links as "found"
if they do not have a URL error. If the site has costum 404
pages, then no pages will have URL error and all will be 
set as found. Use if the site does not have costum 404 pages.

	python colloide100.py --status/urlerror -u www.ex.ex -f /admin/ -p links.txt -v -L 10 -s working.txt

-u is the same with -u in --robots

-f stands for folder. -f /admin/ tells the program to look for 
working links inside the /admin/ folder.

-p is the wordist of pages you want to try.

-v stands for verbose. Use if you want to see the failed attempts
as well.

-L stands for limit. -L 10 means that after finding 10 working pages
the program will stop.

-s stands for save. It will save all working links to a .txt file
of the name that follows.

OTHER FILES, FOLDERS & WORDLISTS:

1) There is a README text file, which is also used as read me
for the GitHub page. In addition there is the LICENSE of the
program.

2) The file with the most common admin page names is links.txt. 
There are two folders with other wordlist. One for possible admin
page names (/specific_links/), and one for possible file names or
directories (/file_links/). Also, there is a common.txt file.

3) There is a file for older versions of MCD's Colloide. There you
can find older version of the program (from 0.8 to 0.95).

4) Extension adder is a program that adds file extensions at the
end of all lines of a wordlist. Just open it and type the wordlist
name (must be a text file). Make sure it's a copy of the original
file, if you do not want the original altered.

5) There is a file with screenshots from previous versions of the
program. You can delete this one :-)
